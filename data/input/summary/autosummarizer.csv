https://www.ted.com/talks/gabby_giffords_and_mark_kelly_be_passionate_be_courageous_be_your_best,"They didnt know how long Gabby would be in a coma, didnt know when that would change and what the prognosis would be.PM: Gabby, has your recovery been an effort to create a new Gabby Giffords or reclaim the old Gabby Giffords?GG: The new one a better, stronger, tougher.
PM: And what were the first signs that recovery was not only going to be possible but you were going to have some semblance of the life that you and Gabby had planned?MK: Well, the first thing, for me, was Gabby was still kind of almost unconscious, but she did something when she was in the ICU hospital bed that she used to do when we might be out to dinner at a restaurant, in that she pulled my ring off and she flipped it from one finger to the next, and at that point I knew that she was still in there.

And shes on a motor scooter there, but its my understanding thats a very tame image of what Gabby Giffords was like growing up.MK: Yeah, Gabby, she used to race motorcycles.

Sometimes wed go clockwise, sometimes counterclockwise, to all those different places, and we didnt really live together until that Saturday morning.

Within an hour of Gabby being shot, I was on an airplane to Tucson, and that was the moment where that had changed things.PM: And also, Gabby, you had run for Congress after being a state senator and served in Congress for six years.
Yes.MK: She was the biggest supporter of my career, and I knew it was the right thing to do.PM: And yet Im trying to imagine, Mark, what that was like, going off onto a mission, one presumes safely, but its never a guarantee, and knowing that Gabby is a MK: Well not only was she still in the hospital, on the third day of that flight, literally while I was rendezvousing with the space station, and youve got two vehicles moving at 17,500 miles an hour, Im actually flying it, looking out the window, a bunch of computers, Gabby was in brain surgery, literally at that time having the final surgery to replace the piece of skull that they took out on the day she was injured with a prosthetic, yeah, which is the whole side of her head."
https://www.ted.com/talks/annmarie_thomas_squishy_circuits,"It turns out that regular Play-Doh that you buy at the store conducts electricity, and high school physics teachers have used that for years.
Well its 150 times more resistant to electric current than that salt dough.
If I take this salt dough, again, its like the play-dough you probably made as kids, and I plug it in a its a two-lead battery pack, simple battery pack, you can buy them at Radio Shack and pretty much anywhere else a we can actually then light things up.
Well now if I take that sugar dough, the sugar dough doesnt want to conduct electricity.
If I place that between, now all the dough is touching, but if I stick that light back in, I have light."

https://www.ted.com/talks/bel_pesce_5_ways_to_kill_your_dreams,"I dedicated the past two years to understanding how people achieve their dreams.
When we think about the dreams we have, and the dent we want to leave in the universe, it is striking to see how big of an overlap there is between the dreams that we have, and projects that never happen.
If you go investigate further, the guy has done 30 apps before and he has done a masters on the topic, a Ph D. He has been working on the topic for 20 years.This is really interesting.
I myself have a story in Brazil that people think is an overnight success.
People may think its an overnight success, but that only worked because for the 17 years prior to that, I took life and education seriously.
When your life is going great, you have put together a great team, and you have growing revenue, and everything is set a time to settle.
With that, over three million people downloaded it, over 50,000 people bought physical copies."
https://www.ted.com/talks/benjamin_barber_why_mayors_should_rule_the_world,"Its increasingly irrelevant to the kinds of decisions we face that have to do with global pandemics, a cross-border problem; with HIV, a transnational problem; with markets and immigration, something that goes beyond national borders; with terrorism, with war, all now cross-border problems.In fact, we live in a 21st-century world of interdependence, and brutal interdependent problems, and when we look for solutions in politics and in democracy, we are faced with political institutions designed 400 years ago, autonomous, sovereign nation-states with jurisdictions and territories separate from one another, each claiming to be able to solve the problem of its own people.
So to come back to the dilemma, if the dilemma is we have old-fashioned political nation-states unable to govern the world, respond to the global challenges that we face like climate change, then maybe its time for mayors to rule the world, for mayors and the citizens and the peoples they represent to engage in global governance.When I say if mayors ruled the world, when I first came up with that phrase, it occurred to me that actually, they already do.
There are scores of international, inter-city, cross-border institutions, networks of cities in which cities are already, quite quietly, below the horizon, working together to deal with climate change, to deal with security, to deal with immigration, to deal with all of those tough, interdependent problems that we face.
Well, to understand that, we need to understand why cities are special, why mayors are so different than prime ministers and presidents, because my premise is that a mayor and a prime minister are at the opposite ends of a political spectrum. the rates shoot up to 70, 75, even 80 percent, because theyre from the neighborhood, because the people they work with are their neighbors, because, like Mayor Booker in Newark, a mayor is likely to get out of his car on the way to work and go in and pull people out of a burning building a that happened to Mayor Booker a or intervene in a mugging in the street as he goes to work because he sees it."
https://www.ted.com/talks/nick_bostrom_on_our_biggest_problems,"Everybody who has looked at this and studied it agrees.Now, if we think about what just reducing the probability of human extinction by just one percentage point a not very much a so thats equivalent to 60 million lives saved, if we just count the currently living people, the current generation.
Think about some time in your life a some people might never have experienced it a but some people, there are just those moments that you have experienced where life was fantastic.It might have been at the moment of some great, creative inspiration you might have had when you just entered this flow stage.
They do great things for a few people who suffer from some specific condition, but for most people, they dont really transform what it is to be human.
We have skin enhancements, clothing.
As far as I can see, all of you are users of this enhancement technology in this room, so thats a great thing.
Mood modifiers have been used from time immemorial a caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, immune system enhancement, vision enhancement, anesthetics a we take that very much for granted, but just think about how great progress that is a like, having an operation before anesthetics was not fun.
If you think about what we normally take as giving life a lot of its meaning a music, humor, eroticism, spirituality, aesthetics, nurturing and caring, gossip, chatting with people a all of these, very likely, are enabled by a special circuitry that we humans have, but that you could have another intelligent life form that lacks these."
https://www.ted.com/talks/richard_dawkins_on_militant_atheism,"In most cases, people who out themselves will help to destroy the myth that there is something wrong with atheists.On the contrary, theyll demonstrate that atheists are often the kinds of people who could serve as decent role models for your children, the kinds of people an advertising agent could use to recommend a product, the kinds of people who are sitting in this room.
I think that generally an agnostic would be the most correct description of my state of mind.
He even became uncharacteristically tetchy with Edward Aveling.
Aveling was a militant atheist who failed to persuade Darwin to accept the dedication of his book on atheism a incidentally, giving rise to a fascinating myth that Karl Marx tried to dedicate Das Kapital to Darwin, which he didnt, it was actually Edward Aveling.
What happened was that Avelings mistress was Marxs daughter, and when both Darwin and Marx were dead, Marxs papers became muddled up with Avelings papers, and a letter from Darwin saying, My dear sir, thank you very much but I dont want you to dedicate your book to me, was mistakenly supposed to be addressed to Marx, and that gave rise to this whole myth, which youve probably heard.
Its a sort of urban myth, that Marx tried to dedicate Kapital to Darwin.Anyway, it was Aveling, and when they met, Darwin challenged Aveling.
Why do you call yourselves atheists?
Agnostic, retorted Aveling, was simply atheist writ respectable, and atheist was simply agnostic writ aggressive.
One of the things weve learned from Darwin is that the human species is only one among millions of cousins, some close, some distant.And there are other possibilities, like naturalist, but that also has problems of confusion, because Darwin would have thought naturalist a Naturalist means, of course, as opposed to supernaturalist a and it is used sometimes a Darwin would have been confused by the other sense of naturalist, which he was, of course, and I suppose there might be others who would confuse it with nudism ."
https://www.ted.com/talks/elif_shafak_the_politics_of_fiction,"Thats what I do in life a telling stories, writing novels a and today I would like to tell you a few stories about the art of storytelling and also some supernatural creatures called the djinni.
Stories accompany me, keeping my pieces and memories together, like an existential glue.Yet as much as I love stories, recently, Ive also begun to think that they lose their magic if and when a story is seen as more than a story.
He was looking for a Turkish woman in the book because I happened to be one.We often talk about how stories change the world, but we should also see how the world of identity politics affects the way stories are being circulated, read and reviewed.
If youre a woman writer from the Muslim world, like me, then you are expected to write the stories of Muslim women and, preferably, the unhappy stories of unhappy Muslim women.
In this way, not only the writers themselves, but also their fictional characters become the representatives of something larger.But I must quickly add that this tendency to see a story as more than a story does not solely come from the West."
https://www.ted.com/talks/roxane_gay_confessions_of_a_bad_feminist,"I am failing as a woman, I am failing as a feminist.I have passionate opinions about gender equality, but I worry that to freely accept the label of feminist, would not be fair to good feminists.Im a feminist, but Im a rather bad one. At least, I wrote an essay, and then I wrote a book called Bad Feminist, and then in interviews, people started calling me The Bad Feminist.I reject the mainstream feminism that has historically ignored or deflected the needs of women of color, working-class women, queer women and transgender women, in favor of supporting white, middle- and upper-class straight women. Too many women, particularly groundbreaking women and industry leaders, are afraid to be labeled as feminists. The last line of my book Bad Feminist says, I would rather be a bad feminist than no feminist at all."
https://www.ted.com/talks/mena_trott_tours_her_blog_world,"And I won it a I reached all of these people, and I had tens of thousands of people reading about my life every day.And then I wrote a post about a banjo.
And today, he is a healthy baby, who, if you read his blog a its snowdeal.org, his fathers blog a he is taking pictures of him still, because he is still his son and he is, I think, at his age level right now because he had received such great treatment from the hospital.So, blogs.
But then you also find peoples blogs, and those are the records of people that are writing daily a not necessarily about the same topic, but things that interest them.
So a the life record of a blog is something that I find incredibly important.And we started with a slide of my Teds, and I had to add this slide, because I knew the minute I showed this, my mom a my mom will see this, because she does read my blog and shell say, Why wasnt there a picture of me?
And to think of what we have the ability to do with our blogs; to think about the people that are on those $100 computers, talking about who they are, sharing these personal stories a this is an amazing thing.Another photo that has greatly influenced me, or a series of photos, is this project thats done by an Argentinean man and his wife."
