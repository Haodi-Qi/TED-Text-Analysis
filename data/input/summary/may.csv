People don't realize that.She just said, ""Gabby was shot.""Gabby, has your recovery been an effort to create a new Gabby Giffords or reclaim the old Gabby Giffords?The new one -- better, stronger, tougher.She understands everything, but the communication is just very difficult because when you look at the picture, the part of your brain where those communication centers are are on the left side of your head, which is where the bullet passed through. I'm optimistic. It will be a long, hard haul, but I'm optimistic.That seems to be the number one characteristic of Gabby Giffords, wouldn't you say?After you got married, however, you continued very independent lives.And also, Gabby, you had run for Congress after being a state senator and served in Congress for six years.I mean, Gabby would run around like a crazy person, never take a day off, maybe a half a day off a month, and whenever she was awake she was working, and she really, really thrived on that, and still does today.So Gabby, what have you learned from your experiences the past few years? I think when something tragic happens in a family, it can pull people together. At the same time, we've got to do everything we can to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the dangerously mentally ill. I'm still fighting to make the world a better place, and you can too.

https://www.ted.com/talks/annmarie_thomas_squishy_circuits,"It turns out that regular Play-Doh that you buy at the store conducts electricity, and high school physics teachers have used that for years.But our homemade play-dough actually has half the resistance of commercial Play-Doh.And that sugar dough? Well it's 150 times more resistant to electric current than that salt dough.Well it means if you them together you suddenly have circuits -- circuits that the most creative, tiny, little hands can build on their own.So if I take this salt dough, again, it's like the play-dough you probably made as kids, and I plug it in -- it's a two-lead battery pack, simple battery pack, you can buy them at Radio Shack and pretty much anywhere else -- we can actually then light things up.But if any of you have studied electrical engineering, we can also create a short circuit. Well now if I take that sugar dough, the sugar dough doesn't want to conduct electricity. If I place that between, now all the dough is touching, but if I stick that light back in, I have light.And once you have the basics, we can make a slightly more complicated circuit.We can even add microprocessors and have this as an input and create squishy sound music that we've done.You could do parallel and series circuits for kids using this.We have a website, it's all there.So I would encourage you all to grab some Play-Doh, grab some salt, grab some sugar and start playing.We don't usually think of our kitchen as an electrical engineering lab or little kids as circuit designers, but maybe we should.",

https://www.ted.com/talks/bel_pesce_5_ways_to_kill_your_dreams,"So I'm here to talk to you today about five ways how not to follow your dreams. Your overnight success story is always a result of everything you've done in your life through that moment. No one else has the perfect answers for your life.The pipes are infinite and you're going to bump your head, and it's a part of the process.When you're growing towards a peak, you need to work harder than ever and find yourself another peak.Maybe if I did little, a couple hundred thousand people would read it, and that's great already.But if I work harder than ever, I can bring this number up to millions.If you have dreams, it's your responsibility to make them happen.But if no one invested in your idea, if no one bought your product, for sure, there is something there that is your fault. Life is never about the goals themselves. The only way to really achieve all of your dreams is to fully enjoy every step of your journey.If every step becomes something to learn or something to celebrate, you will for sure enjoy the journey. So, five tips: Believe in overnight success, believe someone else has the answers for you, believe that when growth is guaranteed, you should settle down, believe the fault is someone else's, and believe that only the goals themselves matter.",
https://www.ted.com/talks/benjamin_barber_why_mayors_should_rule_the_world,"In fact, we live in a 21st-century world of interdependence, and brutal interdependent problems, and when we look for solutions in politics and in democracy, we are faced with political institutions designed 400 years ago, autonomous, sovereign nation-states with jurisdictions and territories separate from one another, each claiming to be able to solve the problem of its own people.And like many others, I've been thinking about what can one do about this, this asymmetry between 21st-century challenges and archaic and increasingly dysfunctional political institutions like nation-states.And my suggestion is that we change the subject, that we stop talking about nations, about bordered states, and we start talking about cities.They are the places where we are born, grow up, are educated, work, marry, pray, play, get old, and in time, die.So to come back to the dilemma, if the dilemma is we have old-fashioned political nation-states unable to govern the world, respond to the global challenges that we face like climate change, then maybe it's time for mayors to rule the world, for mayors and the citizens and the peoples they represent to engage in global governance. When I say if mayors ruled the world, when I first came up with that phrase, it occurred to me that actually, they already do.And so the question is, how can we create a world in which mayors and the citizens they represent play a more prominent role?Well, to understand that, we need to understand why cities are special, why mayors are so different than prime ministers and presidents, because my premise is that a mayor and a prime minister are at the opposite ends of a political spectrum.Mayors are pragmatists, they're problem-solvers.But the second thing about mayors is they are also what I like to call homeboys, or to include the women mayors, homies.They're part of the neighborhood.And as a result, mayors and city councillors and local authorities have a much higher trust level, and this is the third feature about mayors, than national governing officials. Cities are doing this, but not just one by one.They are sharing what they do, and they are making a difference by shared best practices.The bottom line is, we still live politically in a world of borders, a world of boundaries, a world of walls, a world where states refuse to act together.",
https://www.ted.com/talks/nick_bostrom_on_our_biggest_problems,"I want to talk today about -- I've been asked to take the long view, and I'm going to tell you what I think are the three biggest problems for humanity from this long point of view.The first is -- death is a big problem.I just look at the information, and knowledge, and experience that is lost due to natural causes of death in general, and aging, in particular. Existential risk -- the second big problem.Existential risk is a threat to human survival, or to the long-term potential of our species.But there have been four studies -- one by John Lesley, wrote a book on this.He estimated a probability that we will fail to survive the current century: 50 percent.Now, if we think about what just reducing the probability of human extinction by just one percentage point -- not very much -- so that's equivalent to 60 million lives saved, if we just count the currently living people, the current generation.So if you take into account future generations as much as our own, every other moral imperative of philanthropic cost just becomes irrelevant.The third big problem is that life isn't usually as wonderful as it could be. Here are a number of things that we don't want -- illness, involuntary death, unnecessary suffering, cruelty, stunted growth, memory loss, ignorance, absence of creativity.If we want to achieve this, what, in the world, would have to change? Human nature would have to change. And so, to fix this third problem, I think we need -- slowly, carefully, with ethical wisdom and constraint -- develop the means that enable us to go out in this larger space and explore it and find the great values that might hide there.",
https://www.ted.com/talks/richard_dawkins_on_militant_atheism,"I'm a biologist, and the central theorem of our subject: the theory of design, Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection.I believe a true understanding of Darwinism is deeply corrosive to religious faith.Instead, what I want to urge upon you is militant atheism.Darwinian natural selection is so stunningly elegant because it solves the problem of explaining complexity in terms of nothing but simplicity.So, we're used to not challenging religious ideas, and it's very interesting how much of a furor Richard creates when he does it.""In my view, not only is science corrosive to religion; religion is corrosive to science.An atheist is just somebody who feels about Yahweh the way any decent Christian feels about Thor or Baal or the golden calf.Nevertheless, it's an undeniable fact that to own up to being an atheist is tantamount to introducing yourself as Mr. Hitler or Miss Beelzebub. And that all stems from the perception of atheists as some kind of weird, way-out minority. That is, the higher one's intelligence or educational level, the less one is likely to be religious.""To put it bluntly: American political opportunities are heavily loaded against those who are simultaneously intelligent and honest. We need a consciousness-raising, coming-out campaign for American atheists.I suspect that the word ""atheist"" itself contains or remains a stumbling block far out of proportion to what it actually means, and a stumbling block to people who otherwise might be happy to out themselves.The list of things which we strictly have to be agnostic about doesn't stop at tooth fairies and teapots; it's infinite.I think the best of the available alternatives for ""atheist"" is simply ""non-theist.""We need an anti-Templeton to step forward.",
https://www.ted.com/talks/elif_shafak_the_politics_of_fiction,"That's what I do in life -- telling stories, writing novels -- and today I would like to tell you a few stories about the art of storytelling and also some supernatural creatures called the djinni.We tend to form clusters based on similarity, and then we produce stereotypes about other clusters of people.In my opinion, one way of transcending these cultural ghettos is through the art of storytelling.Stories cannot demolish frontiers, but they can punch holes in our mental walls.So from the very beginning, fiction for me was less of an autobiographical manifestation than a transcendental journey into other lives, other possibilities.Stories gave me a sense of center, continuity and coherence, the three big Cs that I otherwise lacked. I'm not saying that fiction has the magnitude of an earthquake, but when we are reading a good novel, we leave our small, cozy apartments behind, go out into the night alone and start getting to know people we had never met before and perhaps had even been biased against.Stories accompany me, keeping my pieces and memories together, like an existential glue.We often talk about how stories change the world, but we should also see how the world of identity politics affects the way stories are being circulated, read and reviewed.Writers are not seen as creative individuals on their own, but as the representatives of their respective cultures: a few authors from China, a few from Turkey, a few from Nigeria.Multicultural writers are expected to tell real stories, not so much the imaginary.Writers are entitled to their political opinions, and there are good political novels out there, but the language of fiction is not the language of daily politics.Imaginative literature is not necessarily about writing who we are or what we know or what our identity is about. We should teach young people and ourselves to expand our hearts and write what we can feel.In the end, stories move like whirling dervishes, drawing circles beyond circles.They connect all humanity, regardless of identity politics, and that is the good news.",
https://www.ted.com/talks/roxane_gay_confessions_of_a_bad_feminist,"I was labeled a woman who doesn't play by the rules, who expects too much, who thinks far too highly of myself, by daring to believe I'm equal -- (Coughs) -- superior to a man.You don't want to be that rebel woman, until you realize that you very much are that woman, and cannot imagine being anyone else.When we talk about the needs of women, we have to consider the other identities we inhabit.We are people with different bodies, gender expressions, faiths, sexualities, class backgrounds, abilities, and so much more.We need to take into account these differences and how they affect us, as much as we account for what we have in common.Without this kind of inclusion, our feminism is nothing. I reject the mainstream feminism that has historically ignored or deflected the needs of women of color, working-class women, queer women and transgender women, in favor of supporting white, middle- and upper-class straight women.Listen, if that's good feminism -- I am a very bad feminist.Too many women, particularly groundbreaking women and industry leaders, are afraid to be labeled as feminists.Bad feminism -- or really, more inclusive feminism -- is a starting point. We go from acknowledging our imperfections to accountability, or walking the walk, and being a little bit brave.We can all make better choices.We can also boldly claim our feminism -- good, bad, or anywhere in between.I am a bad feminist, I am a good woman, I am trying to become better in how I think, and what I say, and what I do, without abandoning everything that makes me human. I hope that we can all be a little bit brave, when we most need such bravery.",
https://www.ted.com/talks/mena_trott_tours_her_blog_world,"But there are blogs that are changing the way we read news and consume media, and these are great examples. These people are reaching thousands, if not millions, of readers, and that's incredibly important.You have my friend, who has a blog on PVRs, personal recorders. He makes enough money just by running ads, to support his family up in Oregon.That's all he does now, and this is something that blogs have made possible.And when I started my blog, it was really this one goal -- I said, ""I am not going to be famous to the world, but I could be famous to people on the Internet."" I don't want to write for this public audience.These things resonate with us, and, if you think about blogs, you think of high art blogs, the history paintings about, you know, all the biblical stories, and then you have this.These are the blogs that interest me: the people that just tell stories. And today, he is a healthy baby, who, if you read his blog -- it's snowdeal.org, his father's blog -- he is taking pictures of him still, because he is still his son and he is, I think, at his age level right now because he had received such great treatment from the hospital. But I think blogs are basically just an evolution, and that's where we are today. It's this record of who you are, your persona. So -- the life record of a blog is something that I find incredibly important. And to think of what we have the ability to do with our blogs; to think about the people that are on those $100 computers, talking about who they are, sharing these personal stories -- this is an amazing thing. Another photo that has greatly influenced me, or a series of photos, is this project that's done by an Argentinean man and his wife.And she wrote about her life dealing with cancer. And this was one of those instances where I realized how much blogging affects our relationship, and flattening this sort of world.And that was amazing, to be able to know that we had empowered that, and that blogging was something that she felt comfortable doing, and the idea that blogging doesn't have to be scary, that we don't always have to be attack of the blogs, that we can be people who are open, and wanting to help and talk to people. That was an amazing thing. ",
