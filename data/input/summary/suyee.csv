https://www.ted.com/talks/annmarie_thomas_squishy_circuits,"I'm a huge believer in hands-on education. But you have to have the right tools. So my wonderful student Sam and I decided to look at the most tangible thing we could think of: Play-Doh. And so we spent a summer looking at different Play-Doh recipes. You see that really salty Play-Doh? Well, it conducts electricity. And this is nothing new. It turns out that regular Play-Doh that you buy at the store conducts electricity, and high school physics teachers have used that for years. But our homemade play-dough actually has half the resistance of commercial Play-Doh. Well it means if you them together you suddenly have circuits -- circuits that the most creative, tiny, little hands can build on their own. And once you have the basics, we can make a slightly more complicated circuit. We call this our sushi circuit. It's very popular with kids. I plug in again the power to it.  We have a website, it's all there. These are the home recipes. We've got some videos. You can make them yourselves. And it's been really fun since we put them up to see where these have gone. 
So I would encourage you all to grab some Play-Doh, grab some salt, grab some sugar and start playing."
https://www.ted.com/talks/kristen_ashburn_s_heart_rending_pictures_of_aids,"When I first arrived in beautiful Zimbabwe, it was difficult to understand that 35 percent of the population is HIV positive. It really wasn't until I was invited to the homes of people that I started to understand the human toll of the epidemic.  I photographed her before and after the birth of her beautiful baby girl, Issa.  For instance, this is Herbert with his grandmother. When I first met him, he was sitting on his grandmother's lap. He has been orphaned, as both of his parents died of AIDS, and his grandmother took care of him until he too died of AIDS. He liked to sit on her lap because he said that it was painful for him to lie in his own bed. This is Joyce who's -- in this picture -- 21. Single mother, HIV positive. And I was last week walking on Lafayette Street in Manhattan and got a call from a woman who I didn't know, but she called to tell me that Joyce had passed away at the age of 23. With every picture, there are individuals who have full lives and stories that deserve to be told. All these pictures are from Zimbabwe. Actually, I was working at the time, doing production for a fashion photographer. And I was constantly reading the New York Times, and stunned by the statistics, the numbers. It was just frightening. So I quit my job and decided that that's the subject that I wanted to tackle. "
https://www.ted.com/talks/bel_pesce_5_ways_to_kill_your_dreams,"When we think about the dreams we have, and the dent we want to leave in the universe, it is striking to see how big of an overlap there is between the dreams that we have, and projects that never happen. One: Believe in overnight success. People may think it's an overnight success, but that only worked because for the 17 years prior to that, I took life and education seriously. Your overnight success story is always a result of everything you've done in your life through that moment. Two: Believe someone else has the answers for you. All sorts of people: your family, your friends, your business partners, they all have opinions on which path you should take: ""And let me tell you, go through this pipe."" And you need to make those decisions yourself. No one else has the perfect answers for your life. Three, and it's very subtle but very important: Decide to settle when growth is guaranteed.There's no time to settle down. Fourth tip, and that's really important: Believe the fault is someone else's. If you have dreams, it's your responsibility to make them happen. Yes, it may be hard to find talent. Yes, the market may be bad. But if no one invested in your idea, if no one bought your product, for sure, there is something there that is your fault. You need to get your dreams and make them happen. And no one achieved their goals alone. But if you didn't make them happen, it's your fault and no one else's. Be responsible for your dreams.And one last tip, and this one is really important as well: Believe that the only things that matter are the dreams themselves. Life is never about the goals themselves. Life is about the journey. The only way to really achieve all of your dreams is to fully enjoy every step of your journey.If every step becomes something to learn or something to celebrate, you will for sure enjoy the journey. So, five tips: Believe in overnight success, believe someone else has the answers for you, believe that when growth is guaranteed, you should settle down, believe the fault is someone else's, and believe that only the goals themselves matter."
https://www.ted.com/talks/benjamin_barber_why_mayors_should_rule_the_world,"Democracy is in trouble, no question about that, and it comes in part from a deep dilemma in which it is embedded. n that dilemma lies the central problem of democracy. And my suggestion is that we change the subject, that we stop talking about nations, about bordered states, and we start talking about cities. Cities are not only the oldest of institutions, they're the most enduring.  More than three out of four people live in urban institutions, urban places, in cities today. So cities are where the action is. Cities are us. When I say if mayors ruled the world, when I first came up with that phrase, it occurred to me that actually, they already do. Well, to understand that, we need to understand why cities are special, why mayors are so different than prime ministers and presidents, because my premise is that a mayor and a prime minister are at the opposite ends of a political spectrum. They have to get things done, they have to put ideology and religion and ethnicity aside and draw their cities together. That's what mayors do. They fix sewers, they get the trains running. There isn't a left or a right way of doing.  They're from the neighborhood. They're part of the neighborhood. And as a result, mayors and city councillors and local authorities have a much higher trust level, and this is the third feature about mayors, than national governing officials. The bottom line is, we still live politically in a world of borders, a world of boundaries, a world of walls, a world where states refuse to act together. The road to global democracy doesn't run through states. It runs through cities. Democracy was born in the ancient polis. I am ready to reach out and embrace a new global democracy, to take back our democracy. "
https://www.ted.com/talks/nick_bostrom_on_our_biggest_problems,"The first is -- death is a big problem. If you look at the statistics, the odds are not very favorable to us. So far, most people who have lived have also died. I think death might be both too familiar and too big for most people to see it as a problem.  Now, the human cost of that is obvious, once you start to think about it -- the suffering, the loss -- it's also, economically, enormously wasteful. A person's lifetime of learning and experience is a lot more than you could put into a single book. Now, if we think about what just reducing the probability of human extinction by just one percentage point -- not very much -- so that's equivalent to 60 million lives saved, if we just count the currently living people, the current generation. So if you take into account future generations as much as our own, every other moral imperative of philanthropic cost just becomes irrelevant. The only thing you should focus on would be to reduce existential risk because even the tiniest decrease in existential risk would just overwhelm any other benefit you could hope to achieve. Every once in a while we have these moments, and we realize just how good life can be when it's at its best. And you wonder, why can't it be like that all the time? You just want to cling onto this. The third big problem is that life isn't usually as wonderful as it could be. And if we think about this, I think it's very clear that there are ways in which we could change things, not just by eliminating negatives, but adding positives. And this is the answer -- we would have to change. Looking ahead, there is a range of technologies that are almost certain to be developed sooner or later. And so, to fix this third problem, I think we need -- slowly, carefully, with ethical wisdom and constraint -- develop the means that enable us to go out in this larger space and explore it and find the great values that might hide there. "
https://www.ted.com/talks/richard_dawkins_on_militant_atheism,"The arguments of so-called ID theorists are the same old arguments that had been refuted again and again, since Darwin down to the present day. If I was a person who were interested in preserving religious faith, I would be very afraid of the positive power of evolutionary science, and indeed science generally, but evolution in particular, to inspire and enthrall, precisely because it is atheistic. Darwinian natural selection is so stunningly elegant because it solves the problem of explaining complexity in terms of nothing but simplicity. In my view, not only is science corrosive to religion; religion is corrosive to science. It teaches people to be satisfied with trivial, supernatural non-explanations, and blinds them to the wonderful, real explanations that we have within our grasp. It teaches them to accept authority, revelation and faith, instead of always insisting on evidence. Bush's bigotry was not an isolated mistake, blurted out in the heat of the moment and later retracted. An atheist is just somebody who feels about Yahweh the way any decent Christian feels about Thor or Baal or the golden calf. And however we define atheism, it's surely the kind of academic belief that a person is entitled to hold without being vilified as an unpatriotic, unelectable non-citizen. So, we've reached a truly remarkable situation, a grotesque mismatch between the American intelligentsia and the American electorate. There should be a snowball effect, a positive feedback, such that the more names we have, the more we get. There could be non-linearities, threshold effects. When a critical mass has been obtained, there's an abrupt acceleration in recruitment. And again, it will need money. So, how about ""humanist""? This has the advantage of a worldwide network of well-organized associations and journals and things already in place. My problem with it is only its apparent anthropocentrism. "
https://www.ted.com/talks/elif_shafak_the_politics_of_fiction,"From her, I learned, amongst many other things, one very precious lesson -- that if you want to destroy something in this life, be it an acne, a blemish or the human soul, all you need to do is to surround it with thick walls. It will dry up inside. Now we all live in some kind of a social and cultural circle. Our imagination might shrink; our hearts might dwindle, and our humanness might wither if we stay for too long inside our cultural cocoons. Stories cannot demolish frontiers, but they can punch holes in our mental walls. And through those holes, we can get a glimpse of the other, and sometimes even like what we see.  I love writing in Turkish, which to me is very poetic and very emotional, and I love writing in English, which to me is very mathematical and cerebral. So I feel connected to each language in a different way. We often talk about how stories change the world, but we should also see how the world of identity politics affects the way stories are being circulated, read and reviewed. Many authors feel this pressure, but non-Western authors feel it more heavily. Multicultural writers are expected to tell real stories, not so much the imaginary. A function is attributed to fiction. In this way, not only the writers themselves, but also their fictional characters become the representatives of something larger. Writers are entitled to their political opinions, and there are good political novels out there, but the language of fiction is not the language of daily politics. Books have saved the introverted, timid child that I was -- that I once was. In the end, stories move like whirling dervishes, drawing circles beyond circles. They connect all humanity, regardless of identity politics, and that is the good news. "
https://www.ted.com/talks/roxane_gay_confessions_of_a_bad_feminist,"I am failing as a woman, I am failing as a feminist.  The feminist label was an accusation, it was an ""F"" word, and not a nice one. I hold certain truths to be self-evident: Women are equal to men. We deserve equal pay for equal work. When we talk about the needs of women, we have to consider the other identities we inhabit. We are not just women. The problem is not that she makes herself economically vulnerable in that choice; the problem is that our society is set up  to make women economically vulnerable when they choose. I reject the mainstream feminism that has historically ignored or deflected the needs of women of color, working-class women, queer women and transgender women, in favor of supporting white, middle- and upper-class straight women. 
We demand perfection from feminists, because we are still fighting for so much, we want so much, we need so damn much. 
We can all make better choices. In one hand, I hold the power to accomplish anything. And in my other, I hold the humbling reality that I am just one woman. 
I am a bad feminist, I am a good woman, I am trying to become better in how I think, and what I say, and what I do, without abandoning everything that makes me human."
https://www.ted.com/talks/mena_trott_tours_her_blog_world,"So, I started to write a blog and I started to create things like these little stories.  And I realized: I don't want to reach these people. I don't want to write for this public audience. And I started to kill my blog slowly. And I did tell personal stories from time to time. These are out there, but it's more of the personal that interests me, and this is who I am. So you have these people aging, and now this is them today, or last year. And that's a powerful thing to have, to be able to track this. I wish that I would have this of my family. I am a blogger -- that is an amazing thing for me, because it captures a moment in time every day. I take a picture of myself -- I've been doing this since last year -- every single day. And, you know, it's the same picture; it's basically the same person. And this was one of those instances where I realized how much blogging affects our relationship, and flattening this sort of world. So, this is her legacy, and I think that my call to action to all of you is: think about blogs, think about what they are, think about what you've thought of them, and then actually do it, because it's something that's really going to change our lives.
