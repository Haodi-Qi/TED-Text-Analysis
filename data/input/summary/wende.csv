She understands everything, but the communication is just very difficult because when you look at the picture, the part of your brain where those communication centers are are on the left side of your head, which is where the bullet passed through. 
Gabby's always been really optimistic.  
We've gone through some tough times and it's only made it stronger. 
So after the tragic incident, Mark, you decided to resign your position as an astronaut, even though you were supposed to take the next space mission. 
And after that, resigned and began what has been a very slow and challenging recovery. 
I think when something tragic happens in a family, it can pull people together.
I want to make the world a better place
And you're doing that even though your recovery has to remain front and center for both of you. You are people who have done service to your country and you are continuing to do that with a new initiative, a new purpose. "
https://www.ted.com/talks/annmarie_thomas_squishy_circuits,"I'm a huge believer in hands-on education.
So my wonderful student Sam and I decided to look at the most tangible thing we could think of: Play-Doh.
We have two favorite recipes -- one that has these ingredients and a second that had sugar instead of salt. 
But our homemade play-dough actually has half the resistance of commercial Play-Doh.
Well it means if you them together you suddenly have circuits -- circuits that the most creative, tiny, little hands can build on their own. 
Right, the current wants to run through the play-dough, not through that LED.
If I want a spinning tail, let's grab a motor, put some play-dough on it, stick it on and we have spinning. 
And once you have the basics, we can make a slightly more complicated circuit.
You could do parallel and series circuits for kids using this. 
We've actually tried to turn it into an electrical engineering lab. 
We don't usually think of our kitchen as an electrical engineering lab or little kids as circuit designers, but maybe we should. "
https://www.ted.com/talks/kristen_ashburn_s_heart_rending_pictures_of_aids,"When I first arrived in beautiful Zimbabwe, it was difficult to understand that 35 percent of the population is HIV positive.
It really wasn't until I was invited to the homes of people that I started to understand the human toll of the epidemic.
He has been orphaned, as both of his parents died of AIDS, and his grandmother took care of him until he too died of AIDS. 
Single mother, HIV positive. 
Joyce's mother is now taking care of her daughter, like so many other Zimbabwean children who've been orphaned by the epidemic.
With every picture, there are individuals who have full lives and stories that deserve to be told.
Actually, I was working at the time, doing production for a fashion photographer. 
And I was constantly reading the New York Times, and stunned by the statistics, the numbers. 
So I quit my job and decided that that's the subject that I wanted to tackle. 
And I first actually went to Botswana, where I spent a month -- this is in December 2000 -- then went to Zimbabwe for a month and a half, and then went back again this March 2002 for another month and a half in Zimbabwe. "
https://www.ted.com/talks/bel_pesce_5_ways_to_kill_your_dreams,"I dedicated the past two years to understanding how people achieve their dreams. 
So I'm here to talk to you today about five ways how not to follow your dreams. 
One: Believe in overnight success. 
Your overnight success story is always a result of everything you've done in your life through that moment. 
Two: Believe someone else has the answers for you.
And you need to make those decisions yourself.
Three, and it's very subtle but very important: Decide to settle when growth is guaranteed.
When you're growing towards a peak, you need to work harder than ever and find yourself another peak.
Fourth tip, and that's really important: Believe the fault is someone else's. 
Be responsible for your dreams. 
And one last tip, and this one is really important as well: Believe that the only things that matter are the dreams themselves.
The only way to really achieve all of your dreams is to fully enjoy every step of your journey.
Believe me, you do that, and you will destroy your dreams. "
https://www.ted.com/talks/benjamin_barber_why_mayors_should_rule_the_world,"Democracy is in trouble, no question about that, and it comes in part from a deep dilemma in which it is embedded. 
We are talking about the cradle of democracy. 
Cities are not only the oldest of institutions, they're the most enduring.
So to come back to the dilemma, if the dilemma is we have old-fashioned political nation-states unable to govern the world, respond to the global challenges that we face like climate change, then maybe it's time for mayors to rule the world, for mayors and the citizens and the peoples they represent to engage in global governance. 
Mayors are pragmatists, they're problem-solvers. 
Mayors are usually from the places they govern. 
And as a result, mayors and city councillors and local authorities have a much higher trust level, and this is the third feature about mayors, than national governing officials.
They have to work together, and they do work together.
In that journey from polis to cosmopolis, we can rediscover the power of democracy on a global level.

https://www.ted.com/talks/nick_bostrom_on_our_biggest_problems,"The firs`t is -- death is a big problem.
I think death might be both too familiar and too big for most people to see it as a problem. 
Existential risk is a threat to human survival, or to the long-term potential of our species.
The only thing you should focus on would be to reduce existential risk because even the tiniest decrease in existential risk would just overwhelm any other benefit you could hope to achieve.
The third big problem is that life isn't usually as wonderful as it could be. 
Human nature would have to change.
All of these would enable, in principle -- be amenable to enhancement. 
Conscientiousness and sympathy.
And then you can imagine some enhancements of human capacities. 
And so, to fix this third problem, I think we need -- slowly, carefully, with ethical wisdom and constraint -- develop the means that enable us to go out in this larger space and explore it and find the great values that might hide there."
https://www.ted.com/talks/richard_dawkins_on_militant_atheism,"I think they're right that evolution is fundamentally hostile to religion.
Living creatures are too complex to have come about by chance; therefore, they must have had a designer. 
My approach to attacking creationism is -- unlike the evolution lobby -- my approach to attacking creationism is to attack religion as a whole.
It teaches them to accept authority, revelation and faith, instead of always insisting on evidence. 
That is, the higher one's intelligence or educational level, the less one is likely to be religious.""
So, we've reached a truly remarkable situation, a grotesque mismatch between the American intelligentsia and the American electorate.
To put it bluntly: American political opportunities are heavily loaded against those who are simultaneously intelligent and honest. 
The list of things which we strictly have to be agnostic about doesn't stop at tooth fairies and teapots; it's infinite.
I think the best of the available alternatives for ""atheist"" is simply ""non-theist.""
And this is because the scientific worldview is so much more exciting, more poetic, more filled with sheer wonder than anything in the poverty-stricken arsenals of the religious imagination.

https://www.ted.com/talks/elif_shafak_the_politics_of_fiction,"That's what I do in life -- telling stories, writing novels -- and today I would like to tell you a few stories about the art of storytelling and also some supernatural creatures called the djinni.
Now we all live in some kind of a social and cultural circle.
But if we have no connection whatsoever with the worlds beyond the one we take for granted, then we too run the risk of drying up inside. 
Ironically, [living in] communities of the like-minded is one of the greatest dangers of today's globalized world.
I also had my first taste of cultural stereotypes there. 
I lived in a very vibrant, diverse neighborhood where I wrote several of my novels.
I'm not saying that fiction has the magnitude of an earthquake, but when we are reading a good novel, we leave our small, cozy apartments behind, go out into the night alone and start getting to know people we had never met before and perhaps had even been biased against. 
I experienced this, not so much as a geographical shift, as a linguistic one.
We often talk about how stories change the world, but we should also see how the world of identity politics affects the way stories are being circulated, read and reviewed.
We're all thought to have something very distinctive, if not peculiar. 
In this way, not only the writers themselves, but also their fictional characters become the representatives of something larger. 
As long as it comes from our hearts, we can write about anything and everything. "
https://www.ted.com/talks/roxane_gay_confessions_of_a_bad_feminist,"Oh, so I call myself a Bad Feminist.
As I got older, I began to accept that I am, indeed, a feminist, and a proud one. 
When we talk about the needs of women, we have to consider the other identities we inhabit.
The problem is not that she makes herself economically vulnerable in that choice; the problem is that our society is set up  to make women economically vulnerable when they choose.
We have this tendency to put visible feminists on a pedestal.
But -- when I justify bad choices, I make it harder for women to achieve equality, the equality that we all deserve, and I need to own that. 
Without these efforts, without taking these stands, our accomplishments are going to mean very little.
They stole my voice, and in the after, I did not dare to believe that anything I might say could matter. 
Through writing and feminism, I also found that if I was a little bit brave, another woman might hear me and see me and recognize that none of us are the nothing the world tries to tell us we are.

https://www.ted.com/talks/mena_trott_tours_her_blog_world,"So -- I'm a blogger, which, probably, to a lot of you, means different things.
This was possible because of the easy nature of blogging tools. 
And I won it -- I reached all of these people, and I had tens of thousands of people reading about my life every day. 
And then I wrote a post about a banjo. 
These are the blogs that interest me: the people that just tell stories. 
It's this record of who you are, your persona. 
And to think of what we have the ability to do with our blogs; to think about the people that are on those $100 computers, talking about who they are, sharing these personal stories -- this is an amazing thing. 
So -- the life record of a blog is something that I find incredibly important. 
I am a blogger -- that is an amazing thing for me, because it captures a moment in time every day.
And she wrote about her life dealing with cancer.
And this was one of those instances where I realized how much blogging affects our relationship, and flattening this sort of world. 
So, this is her legacy, and I think that my call to action to all of you is: think about blogs, think about what they are, think about what you've thought of them, and then actually do it, because it's something that's really going to change our lives. "
