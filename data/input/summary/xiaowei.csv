It will be a long, hard haul, but I'm optimistic.  Gabby's always been really optimistic. She works incredibly hard every day. What attracts you to Gabby? We've gone through some tough times and it's only made it stronger. After you got married, however, you continued very independent lives.  I mean, Gabby would run around like a crazy person, never take a day off, maybe a half a day off a month, and whenever she was awake she was working, and she really, really thrived on that, and still does today. So after the tragic incident, Mark, you decided to resign your position as an astronaut, even though you were supposed to take the next space mission. So Gabby, what have you learned from your experiences the past few years. I think when something tragic happens in a family, it can pull people together. I want to make the world a better place. That's our political action committee, where we are trying to get members of Congress to take a more serious look at gun violence in this country, and to try to pass some reasonable legislation. And not surprisingly for this woman of courage and of a sense of adventure, you just keep challenging yourself, and the sky seems to be the limit."

Well it means if you them together you suddenly have circuits -- circuits that the most creative, tiny, little hands can build on their own. And once you have the basics, we can make a slightly more complicated circuit. We call this our sushi circuit. It's very popular with kids.We have a website, it's all there. These are the home recipes. We've got some videos. You can make them yourselves. We don't usually think of our kitchen as an electrical engineering lab or little kids as circuit designers, but maybe we should. "

https://www.ted.com/talks/bel_pesce_5_ways_to_kill_your_dreams,"I dedicated the past two years to understanding?how people achieve their dreams.?When we think about the dreams we have,?and the dent we want to leave in the universe,?it is striking to see how big of an overlap there is?between the dreams that we have, and projects that never happen.?So I'm here to talk to you today about five ways how not to follow your dreams. One: Believe in overnight success. Two: Believe someone else has the answers for you. Three, and it's very subtle but very important: Decide to settle when growth is guaranteed. Fourth tip, and that's really important: Believe the fault is someone else's. Be responsible for your dreams. And one last tip, and this one is really important as well: Believe that the only things that matter are the dreams themselves. Life is about the journey. The only way to really achieve all of your dreams is to fully enjoy every step of your journey.And your journey is simple -- it's made of steps. So, five tips: Believe in overnight success, believe someone else has the answers for you, believe that when growth is guaranteed, you should settle down, believe the fault is someone else's, and believe that only the goals themselves matter.

https://www.ted.com/talks/benjamin_barber_why_mayors_should_rule_the_world,"Democracy is in trouble, no question about that, and it comes in part from a deep dilemma in which it is embedded. It's increasingly irrelevant to the kinds of decisions we face that have to do with global pandemics, a cross-border problem; with HIV, a transnational problem; with markets and immigration, something that goes beyond national borders; with terrorism, with war, all now cross-border problems. And like many others, I've been thinking about what can one do about this, this asymmetry between 21st-century challenges and archaic and increasingly dysfunctional political institutions like nation-states. And my suggestion is that we change the subject, that we stop talking about nations, about bordered states, and we start talking about cities. When I say if mayors ruled the world, when I first came up with that phrase, it occurred to me that actually, they already do. And so the question is, how can we create a world in which mayors and the citizens they represent play a more prominent role? Well, to understand that, we need to understand why cities are special, why mayors are so different than prime ministers and presidents, because my premise is that a mayor and a prime minister are at the opposite ends of a political spectrum. So mayors are pragmatists and problem-solvers. But the second thing about mayors is they are also what I like to call homeboys, or to include the women mayors, homies. And as a result, mayors and city councillors and local authorities have a much higher trust level, and this is the third feature about mayors, than national governing officials. That's the difference, and the difference has to do with the character of cities themselves, because cities are profoundly multicultural, open, participatory, democratic, able to work with one another. The bottom line is, we still live politically in a world of borders, a world of boundaries, a world of walls, a world where states refuse to act together.  Mayors are considering that idea of how you can actually constitute a global parliament of mayors, and I love that idea, because a parliament of mayors is a parliament of citizens and a parliament of citizens is a parliament of us, of you and of me. I am ready to reach out and embrace a new global democracy, to take back our democracy. "
https://www.ted.com/talks/nick_bostrom_on_our_biggest_problems,"The first is -- death is a big problem. I think death might be both too familiar and too big for most people to see it as a problem. Existential risk -- the second big problem. The only thing you should focus on would be to reduce existential risk because even the tiniest decrease in existential risk would just overwhelm any other benefit you could hope to achieve. The third big problem is that life isn't usually as wonderful as it could be. And if we think about this, I think it's very clear that there are ways in which we could change things, not just by eliminating negatives, but adding positives. If we want to achieve this, what, in the world, would have to change? And this is the answer -- we would have to change. It's worth recalling that there are a lot of other modification technologies and enhancement technologies that we use. Contraceptives, cosmetics and brain reprogramming techniques -- that sounds ominous, but the distinction between what is a technology -- a gadget would be the archetype -- and other ways of changing and rewriting human nature is quite subtle. So let's look at some of the dimensions of human nature that seem to leave room for improvement. Conscientiousness and sympathy. 
It's been done in voles. And then you can imagine some enhancements of human capacities. And so, to fix this third problem, I think we need -- slowly, carefully, with ethical wisdom and constraint -- develop the means that enable us to go out in this larger space and explore it and find the great values that might hide there."
https://www.ted.com/talks/richard_dawkins_on_militant_atheism,"I'm a biologist, and the central theorem of our subject: the theory of design, Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection. Contemporary court cases often concern an allegedly new version of creationism, called ""Intelligent Design,"" or ID. In fact, of course, educated theologians from the Pope down are firm in their support of evolution. I think they're right that evolution is fundamentally hostile to religion. Instead, what I want to urge upon you is militant atheism. Now, the difficult problem for any theory of biological design is to explain the massive statistical improbability of living things. My approach to attacking creationism is -- unlike the evolution lobby -- my approach to attacking creationism is to attack religion as a whole. 
In my view, not only is science corrosive to religion; religion is corrosive to science. And however we define atheism, it's surely the kind of academic belief that a person is entitled to hold without being vilified as an unpatriotic, unelectable non-citizen. And that all stems from the perception of atheists as some kind of weird, way-out minority. To put it bluntly: American political opportunities are heavily loaded against those who are simultaneously intelligent and honest. We need a consciousness-raising, coming-out campaign for American atheists. I think the best of the available alternatives for ""atheist"" is simply ""non-theist"". Now, I said that if I were religious, I'd be very afraid of evolution -- I'd go further: I would fear science in general, if properly understood. A religion, old or new, that stressed the magnificence of the universe as revealed by modern science, might be able to draw forth reserves of reverence and awe hardly tapped by the conventional faiths. We need an anti-Templeton to step forward."
https://www.ted.com/talks/elif_shafak_the_politics_of_fiction,"That's what I do in life -- telling stories,?writing novels --?and today I would like to tell you a few stories?about the art of storytelling?and also some supernatural creatures?called the djinni. From her, I learned, amongst many other things, one very precious lesson -- that if you want to destroy something in this life, be it an acne, a blemish or the human soul, all you need to do is to surround it with thick walls.   So from the very beginning, fiction for me was less of an autobiographical manifestation than a transcendental journey into other lives, other possibilities. We often talk about how stories change the world, but we should also see how the world of identity politics affects the way stories are being circulated, read and reviewed. A function is attributed to fiction. Writers are entitled to their political opinions, and there are good political novels out there, but the language of fiction is not the language of daily politics. Literature has to take us beyond. We should get out of our cultural ghetto and go visit the next one and the next. In the end, stories move like whirling dervishes, drawing circles beyond circles. They connect all humanity, regardless of identity politics, and that is the good news. "
https://www.ted.com/talks/roxane_gay_confessions_of_a_bad_feminist,"I have passionate opinions about gender equality, but I worry that to freely accept the label of ""feminist,"" would not be fair to good feminists. When we talk about the needs of women, we have to consider the other identities we inhabit. I reject the mainstream feminism that has historically ignored or deflected the needs of women of color, working-class women, queer women and transgender women, in favor of supporting white, middle- and upper-class straight women. We have this tendency to put visible feminists on a pedestal. Too many women, particularly groundbreaking women and industry leaders, are afraid to be labeled as feminists. We demand perfection from feminists, because we are still fighting for so much, we want so much, we need so damn much. But -- when I justify bad choices, I make it harder for women to achieve equality, the equality that we all deserve, and I need to own that. We can also boldly claim our feminism -- good, bad, or anywhere in between. Through writing and feminism, I also found that if I was a little bit brave, another woman might hear me and see me and recognize that none of us are the nothing the world tries to tell us we are. I hope that we can all be a little bit brave, when we most need such bravery."
https://www.ted.com/talks/mena_trott_tours_her_blog_world,"I'm a blogger. I have always decided that I was going to be an expert on one thing, and I am an expert on this person, and so I write about it. And I won it -- I reached all of these people, and I had tens of thousands of people reading about my life every day. I don't want to write for this public audience. These are out there, but it's more of the personal that interests me, and this is who I am. These are the blogs that interest me: the people that just tell stories.  But I think blogs are basically just an evolution, and that's where we are today. I am a blogger -- that is an amazing thing for me, because it captures a moment in time every day. I don't write this for this audience; I'm showing it now, but I would go insane if this was really public. So, this is her legacy, and I think that my call to action to all of you is: think about blogs, think about what they are, think about what you've thought of them, and then actually do it, because it's something that's really going to change our lives.
